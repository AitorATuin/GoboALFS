ALFS allows one to invoke hooks to determine how packages will be built.
The GoboLinux hook is installed as $ALFS_DIR/pkgmnt/packInstall-gobolinux.sh,
which executes this package's SymlinkProgram utility after installing
the LFS programs under /Programs/<App>/<Version>.

ALFS will expect to find the contents of this directory packed as a tarball
and available on the web. In practice it's enough to launch an httpd in your
local host and just modify the contents of the 'gobolinux-repository' entity
in $ALFS_DIR/pkgmnt/packageManager-gobolinux.xml. Also please make sure to
update the bootstrap-url and bootstrap-md5 entities in the same file.
